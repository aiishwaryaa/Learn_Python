# 6. Membership Operators
# These operators are used to check if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).

# `in`	Checks if a value is in a sequence	3 in [1, 2, 3] returns True
# `not in`	Checks if a value is not in a sequence	4 not in [1, 2, 3] returnsÂ True


print(3 in[1,4,6,"hii",3])  #true
print(4 not in[1,6,"hii",3])  #true
print(4 in[1,6,"hii",3])  #false
print(3 not in[1,6,"hii",3])  #false
