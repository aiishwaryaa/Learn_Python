# 4. Assignment Operators
# These operators are used to assign values to variables.

# `=`	Assign	x = 5 assigns 5 to x
# `+=`	Add and assign	x += 3 `x = x + 3`
# `-=`	Subtract and assign	x -= 2 subtracts 2 from x
# `*=`	Multiply and assign	x *= 2 multiplies x by 2
# `/=`	Divide and assign	x /= 2 divides x by 2
# `//=`	Floor divide and assign	x //= 2 floor divides x by 2
# `%=`	Modulus and assign	x %= 2 assigns the remainder of x / 2 to x
# `**=`	Exponentiate and assign	x **= 2 squares x
