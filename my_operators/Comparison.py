# `>`	Greater than	5 > 3 results in `True`
# `<`	Less than	5 < 3 results in `False`
# `>=`	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 3 results in `True`
# `<=`	Less than or equal to	5 <= 3 results in `False`

print(4 == 0)   #False
print(4 != 0) #True
print(4 > 10)  #false
print(4 < 5)   #true
print(4 >= 8)  #False
print(4 <= 12)  #true
