Function Notes:

Modular programming:

Modular programming is programming concept. This concept allow us to divide a large solution into several small modules. Each module is developed independently and act is a solution of small problem.
Need/Advantages of modular programming :

    A module developed once and reuse several times in a program.
    Due to readability, A problem will have less no of instruction.
    A problem has less numbers of instruction has less number of errors.
    program is easily maintainable .
    program is easily extendable.

In Python language to apply modular programming we use functions, Classes and Method.

Function:-

A function is an individual unit of small set of instruction to solve a specific task. Function may be inbuilt or user Define.

User define function:- If a function not exist in language, it can be developed by the user. The development of a function has 3 steps.

    Function declaration ( Prototype )
    Function calling
    Function definition

Scope of Variables:
If we define a variable in a function it stays in that function ( nobody knows it out of function )

global -> we use this keyword to import a variable form the global scope
